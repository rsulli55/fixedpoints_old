Hi there, my name is Ryan, welcome to my site.  I am currently an M.S. student studying computer science
at the University of Arizona.  Prior to this, I completed a Ph.D. in Mathematics at UC Irvine.
For my Ph.D. I studied *inner model theory*, an area of set theory.  

### About the name

The name for my website was inspired by a class of the very interesting theorems known as *fixed-point
theorems*.  A **fixed-point** for a function `f` is a point `x` such that `f(x) = x`. In other words,
`f` does not change `x`.  The fixed point theorems often have a form stating that some collection
of functions are guaranteed to have fixed points.  Some examples are:  

- [The Diagonal lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_lemma) which is used in the proof of Godel's incompleteness theorems
- [Roger's fixed-point theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene%27s_recursion_theorem#Rogers's_fixed-point_theorem) stating that total computable functions have fixed points.  Kleene's second recursion theorem is a generalization which gives something like a parametric fixed-point
- [The fixed-point lemma for normal ordinal functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_lemma_for_normal_functions) a basic result in combinatorial set theory
- [Brouwer's fixed-point theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer_fixed-point_theorem) which guarantees that continuous functions on mapping a compact set to itself has a fixed point  
  
I have always found these type of theoems very intriguing, especially the fixed-point 
theorems from logic/computability theory/set theory.  I plan to add content to the website which 
I have found interesting, useful, or fun.  In other words, stuff that I have spent some non-trivial 
amount of time with.  In some sense, the website will reflect "local" fixed-points of my life.
